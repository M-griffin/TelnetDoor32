  Released 03/15/2003 - Beta 6
      Removed the Added Local Echo Detecton, Was causing a lot of problems      
      Went back to a pre-beta 5 source but added all the graphic enhancements from
      Beta 5.  Beta 7 I'm thinking of working in a Telnet Menu, To help keep
      Things more smooth.   
  
      Also added some extra error logging.  If there is a program start error, you can
      open the (Td32-Error.log) Also a per node log is kept for the current connection
      (Td32-Nodex.log) x being the node number the user started the program from.
  
      If your having connection problems please email me the Td32-Nodex.log
      with the IP and port that you are connecting to.
